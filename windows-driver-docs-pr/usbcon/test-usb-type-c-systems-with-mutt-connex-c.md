The MUTT Connection Exerciser Type-C (USB Type-C ConnEx) hardware board is a custom shield for the Arduino board. The shield provides a four-to-one switch to automate interoperability tests for USB Type-C scenarios.

This topic provides guidelines to automate the testing of systems, devices, docks with USB Type-C connectors and their interoperability with the Windows operating system. You can test hardware that belong to one of the following categories:

- System: Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones running a SKU of a version of the Windows operating system with an exposed USB Type-C port.
- Dock: Any USB Type-C device that exposes more than one port.
- Device: Any USB device with a Type-C port that can be attached to a system or dock. This category includes traditional USB devices as well as devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

## Hardware requirements

To perform the USB Type-C interoperability test procedures by using USB Type-C ConnEx Version 2, you need:

- **System under test (SUT)**

    Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones with at least one exposed Type-C USB port.

- **USB Type-C ConnEx**

    The device has one male USB Type-C port (labeled **J1**) to which the SUT is connected. The device also has four other USB ports (labeled **J2**, **J3**, **J4**, **J6**) to which devices can be attached that act as peripherals to the SUT. The device monitors amperage and voltage being drawn from the SUT. You can buy the necessary hardware from [MCCI](https://mcci.com/usb/dev-tools/3201-enhanced-type-c-connection-exerciser/).

    ![USB Type-C ConnEx Connection Exerciser device.](images/newconnexc.jpg)

- **Peripheral USB devices**

    Any USB device with a USB Type-C port that can be attached to the SUT. This category includes traditional USB devices and other devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

- **Micro-USB to USB A Cable**

    You will use this cable to connect your USB Type-C ConnEx to a PC for power and communication (If your SUT has a USB A port, this is where you will connect it).

- **Proxy controller**

    The USB Type-C ConnEx can be controlled by using a proxy for running the tests if the SUT does not have a USB A port. The proxy controller should be a secondary desktop PC or a laptop.

    The proxy controller communicates (with a mobile SUT) to the microcontroller to load the firmware by using a secondary USB port.

## Hardware requirements for older versions

To perform the USB Type-C interoperability test procedures by using USB Type-C ConnEx Version 2, you need:

- **System under test (SUT)**

    Desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, or phones with at least one exposed Type-C USB port.

- **Arduino Mega 2560 R3**

    [Arduino Mega 2560 R3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3) is used as the microcontroller for the test setup.

    ![Shows the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 board.](images/arduino.png)

- **Power adapter for the [Arduino Mega 2560 R3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3) microcontroller**.

- **USB Type-C ConnEx**

    The shield has one male USB Type-C port (labeled **J1**) to which the SUT is connected. The shield also has four other USB ports (labeled **J2**, **J3**, **J4**, **J6**) to which devices can be attached that act as peripherals to the SUT. The shield monitors amperage and voltage being drawn from the SUT. You can buy this board from [MCCI](https://store.mcci.com/products/model-3101-type-c-connection-exerciser?variant=17120953798) or [JJG Technologies](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/typecconne.htm).

    ![USB Type-C ConnEx board.](images/connexc-top.png)

- **USB A-to-B cable**

    You will use this cable to connect a PC to the microcontroller in order to update the firmware on the microcontroller to run tests.

- **Peripheral USB devices**

    Any USB device with a USB Type-C port that can be attached to the SUT. This category includes traditional USB devices and other devices that support the accessory and alternate modes as defined in the USB Type-C specification.

- **USB charger**

    USB Type-C that supports USB Type-C current requirements and optionally [USB Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd#:~:text=USB%20Charger%20%28USB%20Power%20Delivery%29%20USB%20has%20evolved,cell%20phones%2C%20MP3%20players%20and%20other%20hand-held%20devices.). You also need a USB Micro-B charger for **J6**.

- **Proxy controller**

    The USB Type-C ConnEx can be controlled by using a proxy for running the tests. The proxy controller can be one of these entities:

  - Secondary desktop PC or a laptop.

    The proxy controller communicates with a mobile SUT, the microcontroller to load the firmware.

  - SUT by using a secondary USB port.
  - SUT by using a 3.5mm audio jack.

    In this set up, you need:

    - DTMF shield to run tests on SUTs with a single USB Type-C port. DTMF provides the ability to control the shield from a single-port device with an audio jack after the initial flash of the firmware has been completed.

        ![dtmf shield.](images/dtmf.png)

    - 4-pin male-to-male audio cable used to connect the DTMF shield to the SUT. This allows the SUT to control the USB Type-C shield during testing.

        ![3.5mm audio jack.](images/audio-jack.png)

## Software requirements

Make sure you meet these requirements:

- Your SUT must have the version of the Windows operating system with which you want to test interoperability.
- The proxy controller must be running Windows 10.
- [![download the mutt software package.](images/download.png)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=786621) and install the latest MUTT software package on the proxy controller.
 The package is a suite of tools used to run tests with USB Type-C ConnEx. It includes utilities to update the firmware, switch between the peripheral ports, and send requests to simulate test cases. It also contains test driver packages that test the functionality of the buses, its controller, and devices connected to the bus.

- For UCSI based systems we strongly recommended testing with some additional settings to help discover UCSI firmware bugs. This setting will make UCSI firmware issues discoverable and is highly recommended for testing purposes only. Please see [Debugging USCI firmware failures](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-USB-Blog/Debugging-UCSI-firmware-failures/ba-p/283226) in this blog post.

- Installation of the test tools requires an elevated command window.

    To open an elevated command window, the user must be a member of the **Administrators** group on the proxy controller. To open an elevated Command Prompt window, create a desktop shortcut to Cmd.exe, select and hold (or right-click) the Cmd.exe shortcut, and select **Run as administrator**.

### Sample Commands

Connect to a port

```console
connexutil.exe /setport 1
```

Alternatively use the port name as printed on the board:

```console
connexutil.exe /setport J3
```

Disconnect all ports

```console
connexutil.exe /setport 0
```

Loop through all ports

```console
for %p in (1 2 3 4)
do (
    connexutil.exe /setport %p
    echo Confirm device on port %p
    pause
)
```

## Scripts for controlling the USB Type-C ConnEx board

These scripts exercise the control interface supported by ConnExUtil.exe to run sequential and stress type tests with the USB Type-C ConnEx through the command line. All of these scripts support the optional command line parameter **audio** to indicate that the USB Type-C ConnEx board is connected over the 3.5 mm audio interface. By default they will only attempt to use USB connected boards.

### Simple connect / disconnect sequence: CXLOOP.CMD

Connects and disconnects the SUT to and from each port (1-4) and pauses on each port prompting the tester to validate the connection on that port.

### Random connect / disconnect loop: CXSTRESS.CMD

Connects and disconnects the SUT to and from each port at random for a random interval of 0.0-5.0 seconds in an infinite loop. When connecting to the USB Type-C ports it will randomly enable or disable SuperSpeed connection on that port, and will randomly instruct the board to disconnect quickly on that port at some random interval 0 â€“ 999 ms.

The command line parameter **C** causes the script to only switch between the USB Type-C ports and the disconnected state. A numeric command line parameter resets the maximum random interval between switches from the default of 5.0 seconds to the input value in seconds. Parameters may be passed in any order.

### Long running power measurement: CXPOWER.CMD

Saves the amperage and voltage reported by the USB Type-C ConnEx to output file power.csv at 2 second intervals. The data is formatted as comma-separated variables as follows:

**index**,**time**,**volts**,**amps**

*index* is the device index given by the **ConnExUtil.exe /list** command so multiple devices may be monitored simultaneously.

*time* is the raw timestamp in seconds.

*volts* and *amps* are recorded to 2 decimal places.

After capture is complete, this data may be post processed into charts showing power consumption over time, for example the power consumption for the duration of a battery charge cycle. A numeric command line parameter resets the default measurement interval of 2 seconds to the input value in seconds.

## About test cases

The USB Type-C interoperability test procedures are divided into two sections: functional testing (FT) and stress testing (ST). Each test section describes the test case and identifies the category that applies to the test. The product must be tested against the entire applicable category. Certain test cases contain links to relevant hints and tips for additional information. This section is focused on USB Type-C functionality and experience. A USB Type-C solution may contains other USB components such as a USB hub or USB controller. Detailed testing of USB hubs and controllers is covered in both the USB-IF's [xHCI interoperability test procedures](https://www.usb.org/document-library/xhci-interoperability-test-procedures-peripherals-hubs-and-hosts-version) and the Windows Hardware Certification Kit.

These test cases are based on the ConnExUtil commands and example scripts [Scripts for controlling the USB Type-C ConnEx board](#scripts-for-controlling-the-usb-type-c-connex-board). The test cases refer to the scripts. Customize the scripts as required for your test scenario.

[Device Enumeration](#ft-case-1-device-enumeration)  
Confirms that core aspects of device enumeration are functional.

[Alternate Mode Negotiation](#ft-case-2-alternate-mode-negotiation)  
Confirms supported alternate modes.

[Charging and power delivery (PD)](#ft-case-3-charging-and-power-delivery-pd)  
Confirms charging with USB Type-C.

[Role Swap](#ft-case-4-role-swap)  
Confirms role swap.

The stress testing section describes procedures for stress and edge case scenarios, which test device stability over a period of time. Stress testing does require a custom device (the SuperMUTT) for legacy USB validation (non USB Type-C). Additional testing and automation can be achieved with the upcoming USB Type-C test device.

[Device Enumeration](#st-case-1-device-enumeration)  
Confirms that core aspects of device enumeration are functional.

[Charging and power delivery (PD)](#st-case-2-charging-and-power-delivery-pd)  
Confirms charging with USB Type-C.

## Validating success or failure of the tests

### Confirming charging and power

The onboard LCD on the USB Type-C ConnEx displays power (volts, amps, and direction). Confirm that it matches expectations from power sources plugged in and actively enabled with the USB Type-C ConnEx .

### Confirming device addition on desktops

1. Identify the USB host controller to which your device is connected.
2. Make sure that the new device appears under the correct node in Device Manager.
3. For USB 3.0 hubs connected to a USB 3.0 port, expect to see two hub devices: one enumerated at SuperSpeed and another at high speed.

### Confirm device removal on desktops

1. Identify your device in Device Manager.
2. Perform the test step to remove the device from the system.
3. Confirm that the device is no longer present in Device Manager.
4. For a USB 3.0 hub, check that both devices (SuperSpeed and companion hubs) are removed. Failure to remove a device in this case may be a device failure and should be investigated by all components involved to triage the appropriate root cause.

### Confirm device functionality

- If the device is a USB hub, make sure that the devices that are downstream of the hub are functional. Verify that other devices can be connected to available ports on the hub.
- If the device is an HID device, test its functionality. Make sure that a USB keyboard types, a USB mouse moves the cursor, and a gaming device is functional in the game controller's control panel.
- A USB audio device must play and/or record sound.
- A storage device must be accessible and should be able to copy a file 200MB or more in size.
- If the device has multiple functions, such as scan & print, make sure to test both the scan and print functionality.
- If the device is a USB Type-C device, confirm that the applicable USB and alternate modes are functional.
