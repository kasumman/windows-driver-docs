## Remarks

Some of these reasons describe scanner state that the scanner cannot enter according to the currently defined WSD Scan Service operation set. For example, the scanner can be **Paused** even though there is no "*PauseScanner*" operation. Such states are present because some other protocol or console action can cause the scanner to enter that state.

The WSD Scan Service must support the values that represent conditions that are detectable in its implementation. Therefore, a WSD Scan Service can support only that subset of allowed values that it can detect.

You can extend the allowed values, but there are implications when you extend this list on a client. The client typically localizes the [**ScannerStateReasons**](scannerstatereasons.md) value (as with other string variable values) to the language of the end user, so the client will not recognize a vendor extension value. However, the client can display the value that is received directly. This value should be in English, so some end users might not understand the value. Alternatively, the Scan Service can use the general **AttentionRequired** value and then explain the problem on the scanner console, which the user will see when they are at the scanner.
