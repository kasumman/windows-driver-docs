# WIA\_IPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD


The **WIA\_IPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD** property is used to enable scan ahead in the hardware device (scan at highest possible speed, buffering scanned images in the scanner's internal memory, transferring buffered images in parallel to the client application at an equal or lower speed). The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.




**Note**  This property replaces [**WIA\_DPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD\_PAGES**](wia-dps-scan-ahead-pages.md), which is now obsolete.

 

Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_LIST

Access Rights: Read/Write

## Remarks

The following table describes the valid values for the **WIA\_IPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD** property.

<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>WIA_SCAN_AHEAD_DISABLED</p></td>
<td><p>Scan ahead is disabled. This is the required default value if the property is supported.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>WIA_SCAN_AHEAD_ENABLED</p></td>
<td><p>Scan ahead is enabled. The WIA client application must download images as fast as it can. If the scan job is canceled before it is finished, some scanned documents may be lost (not yet transferred to the application).</p></td>

This property is valid only for the Feeder item (WIA\_CATEGORY\_FEEDER) and is optional.
