# WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_GRAPHICS


The **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_GRAPHICS** property is used to report whether the Imprinter/Endorser item supports graphics and image data along with text. Graphics are typically used by the device to print/endorse near the text, or as a background image. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.




Property Type: VT\_I4 (Boolean)

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE

Access Rights: Read-only

## Remarks

If **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_GRAPHICS** is supported and set to a value of nonzero (True), the Imprinter/Endorser supports graphic data.

This property is required for all Imprinter/Endorser items, but it can be implemented to always report a value of 0 (False).
