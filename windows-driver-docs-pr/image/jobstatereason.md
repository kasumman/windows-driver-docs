## Remarks

You must support the values that represent conditions that WSD Scan Service implementations can detect. Therefore, you can support only a subset of allowed values if specific **JobStateReason** reasons are undetectable in your implementation.

You can extend the allowed values, but extending this list has implications on the client. The client typically localizes the **JobStateReason** value (as with other string variable values) to the language of the user. However, the client will not recognize a vendor-extended value. The client can display the value that is received "as is", but this value will appear in English, so some users might not understand the value.
