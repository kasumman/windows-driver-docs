# WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_YOFFSET


The **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_YOFFSET** property is used to configure the vertical coordinate, in thousandths of an inch (0.001"), of the top-left corner of the imprinting/endorsing region, relative to the top-left corner of the physical document to be scanned and imprinted/endorsed. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.




Property Type: VT\_UI4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/Write

## Remarks

The WIA minidriver can update the valid range of values and the current value (if it becomes out of range) to the closest available position when the [**WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER**](wia-ips-printer-endorser.md) property is changed to a new specific input source (in other words, from flatbed to feeder).

This property is optional for all Imprinter/Endorser data source items.
