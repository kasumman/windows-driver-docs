# WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION


The WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION property contains the file name extension for a particular file format. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.

## <span id="ddk_wia_ipa_filename_extension_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_IPA_FILENAME_EXTENSION_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_BSTR

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE

Access Rights: Read-only

## Remarks

The minidriver updates the WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION property to reflect the current value of the [**WIA\_IPA\_FORMAT**](wia-ipa-format.md) property.

For example, if WIA\_IPA\_FORMAT is WiaImgFmt\_JPEG, WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION should be "jpg". If WIA\_IPA\_FORMAT is WiaImgFmt\_BMP, WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION should be "bmp". Note that the file name extension does not include the period (".").

The WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION property is recommended for drivers that support standard formats and is required for drivers that implement custom-defined formats. WIA\_IPA\_FILENAME\_EXTENSION informs the application of the correct file name extension to use during the transfer of privately formatted files. For example, if the A. Datum Corporation created a WIA driver that transferred a file in a new format, the company could specify an extension of "adc". This extension enables applications to transfer data in that format to a file and to create a file name such as *Myfile.adc*, which is useful to others who understand the new extension.
