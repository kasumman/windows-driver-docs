# WIA\_DPC\_COMPRESSION\_SETTING


The WIA\_DPC\_COMPRESSION\_SETTING property contains either a range or a list of integers to represent perceived image quality.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dpc_compression_setting_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPC_COMPRESSION_SETTING_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_LIST or WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The WIA\_DPC\_COMPRESSION\_SETTING property is intended to approximately linearly describe the perceived image quality over a broad range of scene content. Smaller integers represent lower quality (that is, maximum compression), and larger integers represent higher quality (that is, minimum compression). Any available settings on a device are relative only to that device and are therefore device-specific.
