# WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP


The WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP property enables you to adjust the set point of a digital camera's auto-exposure control.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dpc_exposure_comp_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPC_EXPOSURE_COMP_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_RANGE or WIA\_PROP\_LIST

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

You can use the WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP property to adjust the set point of a digital camera's auto-exposure control. Setting WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP to zero does not change the factory-set auto-exposure level.

The units of WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP are in "stops" that are scaled by a factor of 1000, to allow for fractional stop values. Setting WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP to 2000 corresponds to two stops more exposure (four times more energy on the sensor), so images will be brighter. Setting WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_COMP to âˆ’1000 corresponds to one stop less exposure (one-half the energy on the sensor), so images will be darker.

The setting values are in Additive System of Photographic Exposure (APEX) units.

This property may be expressed as either a list or a range of values. This property is typically used only when a device has the [**WIA\_DPC\_EXPOSURE\_MODE**](wia-dpc-exposure-mode.md) property set to EXPOSUREMODE\_MANUAL.
