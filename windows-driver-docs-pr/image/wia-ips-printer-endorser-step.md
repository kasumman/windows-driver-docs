# WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_STEP


By default the imprinter/endorser imprints or endorses on each document page that is scanned. This mandatory default behavior can be changed by the client by using the **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_STEP** property. For example, the client application can set the current value to 2 to have every other scanned page imprinted/endorsed (0, 2, 4, 6, ...). The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.




Property Type: VT\_UI4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/Write

## Remarks

The mandatory default value for the **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_STEP** property is 1 (each page). A value of 0 is invalid.

As for most WIA\_PROP\_RANGE properties, the WIA minidriver can implement a range containing one single value, minimum equal with maximum and a step value of zero.

This property must be supported by all Imprinter/Endorser data source items. The value of 1 (each page) is required.
