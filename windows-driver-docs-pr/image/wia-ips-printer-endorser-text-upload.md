# WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_TEXT\_UPLOAD


The **WIA\_IPS\_PRINTER\_ENDORSER\_TEXT\_UPLOAD** property is used to report whether the Imprinter/Endorser item supports upload text data transfers. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.




Property Type: VT\_I4 (Boolean)

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE

Access Rights: Read-only

## Remarks

If the current value of this property is set to a value of True (nonzero), the WIA minidriver supports receiving text data that is uploaded by the application client. The transfer file format is described by the [**WIA\_IPA\_FORMAT**](wia-ipa-format.md) and [**WIA\_IPA\_TYMED**](wia-ipa-tymed.md) properties implemented on the same Imprinter/Endorser item.

This property is required for all Imprinter/Endorser items, but it can be implemented to always report a value of 0 (False). Also, if the Imprinter/Endorser item reports WiaItemTypeFile and WiaItemTypeTransfer, this property is required and must report a nonzero value (True).
