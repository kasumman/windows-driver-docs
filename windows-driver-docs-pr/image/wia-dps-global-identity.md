# WIA\_DPS\_GLOBAL\_IDENTITY


The WIA\_DPS\_GLOBAL\_IDENTITY property contains the SOAP address of a web services scanner device. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.

Property Type: VT\_BSTR

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE

Access Rights: Read-only

## Remarks

The WIA minidriver initializes this property at run time by reading the PKEY\_PNPX\_GlobalIdentity device property from the Function Instance object.

Both PKEY\_PNPX\_GlobalIdentity and PKEY\_PNPX\_ID contain a unique ID of the UPnP Device. The difference is that PKEY\_PNPX\_GlobalIdentity always contains the UUID of the root device for all Function Instances, while PKEY\_PNPX\_ID contains the UUID of the Device/Sub-Device that the Function Instance represents.
