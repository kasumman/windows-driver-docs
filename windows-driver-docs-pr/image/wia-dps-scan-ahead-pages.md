# WIA\_DPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD\_PAGES


The WIA\_DPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD\_PAGES property contains a value that indicates whether a scanner will cache pages in a scanner buffer before sending them to an application.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dps_scan_ahead_pages_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPS_SCAN_AHEAD_PAGES_SI"></span>


**Note**  This property is now obsolete. Use [**WIA\_IPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD**](wia-ips-scan-ahead.md) instead.

 

Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_RANGE (from zero through the maximum number of pages that the document feeder can hold)

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

If the WIA\_DPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD\_PAGES property is zero, scan ahead is disabled, and the scanner will not scan ahead any pages.

If the scanner performs data transfers on the buffered scan-ahead item, the scanner will retrieve the buffered pages. WIA properties cannot be changed during a scan-ahead operation. WIA\_DPS\_SCAN\_AHEAD\_PAGES is optional.
