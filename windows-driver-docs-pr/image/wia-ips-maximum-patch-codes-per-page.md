# WIA\_IPS\_MAXIMUM\_PATCH\_CODES\_PER\_PAGE


The **WIA\_IPS\_MAXIMUM\_PATCH\_CODES\_PER\_PAGE** property describes the maximum number of patch codes that the device can and should detect on one document page side when patch code detection is enabled.




Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/Write

## Remarks

A value of 0 means "no maximum". The application can decrease the current value of this property in order to reduce the time spent on patch code detection and increase the scan speed.

This property is required for all Patch Code Reader items but it can be implemented as a range container containing only the value of 0 (minimum equal with maximum and set to 0, step size of 0).
