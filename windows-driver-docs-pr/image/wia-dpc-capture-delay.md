# WIA\_DPC\_CAPTURE\_DELAY


The WIA\_DPC\_CAPTURE\_DELAY property contains a value that represents the amount of time delay, in milliseconds, that should be inserted between the capture trigger and the actual initiation of a data capture.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dpc_capture_delay_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPC_CAPTURE_DELAY_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_LIST or WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The WIA\_DPC\_CAPTURE\_DELAY property is not intended to be used to describe the time between frames for single-initiation, multiple captures such as burst or time lapse, which have separate interval properties ([**WIA\_DPC\_BURST\_INTERVAL**](wia-dpc-burst-interval.md) and [**WIA\_DPC\_TIMELAPSE\_INTERVAL**](wia-dpc-timelapse-interval.md), respectively). In those cases, WIA\_DPC\_CAPTURE\_DELAY still serves as an initial delay before the first image in the series is captured, independent of the time between frames. For no precapture delay, this property should be set to zero
