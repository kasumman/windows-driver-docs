# WIA\_DPC\_UPLOAD\_URL


The WIA\_DPC\_UPLOAD\_URL property describes a standard Internet URL.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dpc_upload_url_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPC_UPLOAD_URL_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_BSTR

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The WIA\_DPC\_UPLOAD\_URL property describes a URL that images or objects, after they are acquired from a device, can be uploaded to in one of the following scenarios:

-   A WIA application reads WIA\_DPC\_UPLOAD\_URL and allows a user to automatically upload images to the URL.

-   An application sets the URL, and other devices (for example, kiosks) use WIA\_DPC\_UPLOAD\_URL.

The Microsoft Windows operating system does not upload images.
