# WIA\_DPC\_PICT\_HEIGHT


The WIA\_DPC\_PICT\_HEIGHT property contains the height, in pixels, to use for newly captured images.

## <span id="ddk_wia_dpc_pict_height_si"></span><span id="DDK_WIA_DPC_PICT_HEIGHT_SI"></span>


Property Type: VT\_I4

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_LIST or WIA\_PROP\_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The list of valid values for the WIA\_DPC\_PICT\_HEIGHT property has a one-to-one correspondence with the list of valid values for the [**WIA\_DPC\_PICT\_WIDTH**](wia-dpc-pict-width.md) property. If the individual width and height are linearly settable and orthogonal to each other, you can express them as a range.
