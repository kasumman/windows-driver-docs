# WIA\_DPC\_RGB\_GAIN


The WIA\_DPC\_RGB\_GAIN property contains a null-terminated Unicode string that represents the red, green, and blue gain, respectively, that is applied to image data. For example, "4:25:50" represents a red gain of 4, a green gain of 25, and a blue gain of 50.

Property Type: VT\_BSTR

Valid Values: WIA\_PROP\_NONE or WIA\_PROP\_LIST

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The WIA\_DPC\_RGB\_GAIN property is parsed as follows: *R*:*G*:*B*. *R* represents the red gain, *G* represents the green gain, and *B* represents the blue gain. For example, for an RGB ratio of red=4, green=2, blue=3, the RGB string could be "4:2:3" or "2000:1000:1500". These values are relative to each other. You can use larger numbers for added granularity, but the color will be same if the ratio of red, green, and blue remains the same. The string parser for this property value should support UINT16 integers for *R*, *G*, and *B*.
