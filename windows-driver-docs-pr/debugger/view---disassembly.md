Click **Disassembly** on the **View** menu to open the [Disassembly window](disassembly-window.md). If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing ALT+7 or clicking the **Disassembly (Alt+7)** button (![screen shot of the disassembly button.](images/tbdisasm2.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Disassembly Window](disassembly-window.md).
