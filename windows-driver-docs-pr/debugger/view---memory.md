Click **Memory** on the **View** menu to open a new [Memory window](memory-window.md).

**Note**   You can have multiple Memory windows open at the same time. Each window can display a different region of memory. Only the Memory window and the [Source window](source-window.md) have this ability. All other debugging information windows are limited to a single instance.

 

The **View** command is equivalent to pressing ALT+5 or clicking the **Memory window (Alt+5)** button (![screen shot of the memory button.](images/tbmem.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Memory Window](memory-window.md).
