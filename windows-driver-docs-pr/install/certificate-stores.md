# Certificate Stores


On a computer that has the Windows operating system installed, the operating system stores a certificate locally on the computer in a storage location called the *certificate store*. A certificate store often has numerous certificates, possibly issued from a number of different certification authorities (CAs).

This section includes the following topics:

[Local Machine and Current User Certificate Stores](local-machine-and-current-user-certificate-stores.md)

[Trusted Root Certification Authorities Certificate Store](trusted-root-certification-authorities-certificate-store.md)

[Trusted Publishers Certificate Store](trusted-publishers-certificate-store.md)

 
For info on viewing certificates, see [How to: View certificates with the MMC snap-in](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-view-certificates-with-the-mmc-snap-in).
