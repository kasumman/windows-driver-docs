Depending on the capability of the graphics adapter, Direct3D allows applications to utilize hardware acceleration for the entire 3-D rendering pipeline or for partial acceleration. Newer versions of the Direct3D APIs such as Direct3D 9Ex and Microsoft Direct3D 10 are available only starting with Windows Vista because the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) provides the display driver interfaces needed for the functionality. This figure shows the incremental versions of Direct3D APIs that are supported on the various versions of WDDM:
